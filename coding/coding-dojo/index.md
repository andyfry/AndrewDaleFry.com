A coding dojo is a place where we can practice our coding skills so we can improve as software developers. Ideally, we would practice with others so that we both teach and learn beter ways of solving problems. For now, I will be recording my practice so that it can be shared with the world. If you see an area for improvement, let me know. Eventually, I will add commenting so that you can share your ideas with me here.

Katas are small, self-contained problems that let us practice our skills. The goal isn't to solve the problem. The goal is to improve the way we solve problems in general.
