If you are on this site, I will assume that you are a friend that I have shared this with, either for feedback or to give you insight into what I have been doing. If you have stumbled upon this site from the outside world, I welcome you as well. Maybe you are a future friend that will share your insight as well.

### Purpose of this site
This site is a place that I can record my thoughts, publish side projects and share things that I enjoy. It will focus a lot on software development and the things I have learned about it over the years. It will also focus on gaming, mostly video games but maybe board games and role-playing games as well. Also, if there is something else I ever want to share with the world, this will be my place to do it.

### Growing the Site
This site is starting as a skeleton of what I hope it will grow to become. I will continue to expand and polish the site as I add more content. I am excited to discover what the site will become.

###  Feedback
Any feedback you might have is both welcomed and valued. You can reach out to me through my Email: AndrewDaleFry@gmail.com. Maybe in the future, I will add the ability to comment directly on the page. I will add that to my TODO list.
