 This site is a place that I can publish side projects, articles and videos.

 My goal is to create this site out in the open, warts and all. As I make improvements or work on side projects, I would like to record videos or live stream my progress. As I work toward that goal, you can see my progress in the source repository [here](https://github.com/andyfry/AndrewDaleFry.com).

 The site is currently being created by hand in raw html and css. It is stored in a repository on [github](https://github.com/andyfry/AndrewDaleFry.com) and automatically pushed to its current hosting platform at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

In the future, I plan to switch this site to be created using a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/). I will probably try out several and even experiment with creating my own. It is most likely that I will use one of the more popular options like Jekyll or Hugo, but experimenting will teach me a lot and should be fun.
    
I have roughed out the styling and layout as I add new sections and features. Once I am done with the features that I know I want, I will focus more on polishing up the styling and makeing sure it looks good for all resolutions.
    
Below is my todo list in no particular order. If you have ideas or critiques, send them to me and I will add to my list.
### ToDo:
* Flesh out the about section.
* Flesh out the coding section.
* Flesh out the gaming section.
* Convert to using Static Site Generator
* Make Site Layout Responsive/Mobile First
* Finish Styling
