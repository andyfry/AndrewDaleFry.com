### My First Computer
My first computer was a Tandy Color Computer 3; a machine that would play game cartridges. If you booted without a cartridge, you entered, what we would call now, a REPL for Extended Color BASIC 2. This was some of my earliest introduction to both gaming and programming. The [manual](http://colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/Color%20Computer%203%20Exended%20Basic%20(Tandy).pdf) that was included promised it would teach you: 
* Composing Music
* Creating light shows
* Playing games
* Painting pictures


It didn't have any storage so any programes were wiped out when you turned off the machine. I remember wanting to show off a program that was a simple animation of a Yo-Yo. I had to plug the computer into my Grandparents TV and retype the program while everyone waited. Later, I got an adapter that would let me save programs to an audio cassette.


### Early Programming
Most of my early "programming" experience was typing in programs from magazines and books into GW-BASIC on my grandmothers 286 PC. Later, in Highschool I graduated to using Borland C++ 5 on my own Pentium MMX PC. I remember creating some horribly memory innefficient programs for creating and editing game assets.
