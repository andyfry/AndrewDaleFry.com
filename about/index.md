My name is Andrew Fry. Most people call me Andy. I am a software developer and gamer originally from Wichita, KS who is now living in Houston, TX.

One of my first memories is at the age of four seeing my mother's coworkers gathered around a computer playing [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_I). I remember wondering what had them all so enthralled. I have been fascinated with both computers and games ever since.

I enjoy playing board games, card games, video games and roleplaying games. I also love to collect weird and obscure sports. My favorite being [Ice Cross Downhill](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/tags/ice-cross-downhill), a downhill race on ice skates with jumps and turns.
